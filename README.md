Dijktra's Algorithm

I’ve implemented Dijktra’s Algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph (also included) that
has a time efficient topological sorting method. 
My algorithm is implemented using a priority queue in my personal implementation of a minimum binary heap.
